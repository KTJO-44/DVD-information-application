# Description

My family has many physical DVDs in various locations around the house. This application is meant to provide a solution to finding a DVD - firstly, to see if the physical DVD is available, and then where to find it.
DVDs are entered manually, then can be searched, edited and deleted.
There is also a similar problem for CDs, and the development for this part of the application is a WIP.

The logo on the homepage was made using Adobe Photoshop to edit DVD FLLC's DVD logo.
